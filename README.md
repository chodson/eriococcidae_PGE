This paper explores the presence and mechanism of paternal genome elimination in Eriococcidae - a family of scale insects. Paternal genome elimination is a system of reproduction where males eliminate paternally derived chromosomes at some point in development/meiosis so that they only transmit maternally derived chromosomes to offspring. Eriococcidae ancestrally exhibits PGE, but there are reports that some species may have lost PGE transmission. Here we explore whether there is evidence for this by looking:
1. for evidence of PGE in the appearance of male somatic cells in many species across the family (male somatic cells in many PGE species contain a condensed heterochromatic ball of paternally derived chromosomes)
2. at the mechanism of meiosis in males cytologically in *Cystococcus* species - which show variation in whether they have a heterochromatic ball of paternally derived chromosomes in male somatic cells
3. at inheritance patterns from mothers to sons in *Cystococcus* using microsatellite markers to see whether transmission patterns are consistent with PGE.
4. at whether *Cystococcus* males only express maternally inherited chromosomes - like other scale insects with PGE- or whether they express both maternally and paternally derived chromosomes.
